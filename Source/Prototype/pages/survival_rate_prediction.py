        The primary purpose of this platform is to identify and predict the survival likelihood of a patient that is in critical condition, helping users understand their health risks 
        through a user-friendly interface. It focuses on several key areas:
        
        - **Personalization**: Each prediction provides patients with tailored insights based on their unique health data, offering a clear understanding of individual risk factors.
        - **Early Detection**: By inputting their current health metrics, patients can identify high-risk areas early, enabling them to take proactive steps toward improving their health.
        - **Continuous Health Tracking**: Patients can use the platform periodically to track changes in their survival rate predictions over time, providing motivation for consistent health monitoring and improvement.
