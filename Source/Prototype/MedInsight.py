Indonesia, with its rapidly growing population, faces significant challenges in healthcare, particularly due to the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and rising hospitalization costs. While the governmentâ€™s Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) program has expanded healthcare access, issues such as regional disparities, a shortage of medical professionals, and escalating costs of chronic disease management remain pressing. The prevalence of diseases like heart attack, stroke, angina, depressive disorders, arthritis, and skin cancer significantly contributes to both mortality and healthcare expenditure.

This project utilizes predictive analytics to forecast disease risks and provide insights into hospitalization outcomes. The disease prediction models will focus on conditions such as heart attack, stroke, angina, depressive disorders, arthritis, and skin cancerâ€”all of which are major contributors to mortality and healthcare costs in Indonesia. Additionally, the project will develop models to predict hospitalization insights like survival rates, surgery risks, hospitalization costs, and admission durations. These models will empower healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions, optimize patient care, and enhance hospital resource allocation.

By integrating disease prediction and hospitalization insights, the project aims to support Indonesia's healthcare system in addressing these challenges, improving patient outcomes, and enhancing the overall efficiency of healthcareÂ services.""")

# Displaying numbered points and bullet points in markdown
st.markdown("""
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather relevant hospital datasets that include patient demographics, medical conditions, test results, admission types, historical stay durations, surgical risk data, and survival rate information. Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, and categorizing features (e.g., age, gender, medical conditions, surgical risk factors, and survival status). This will also involve encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features as necessary.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost and Random Forest) to create models for:
    - **Disease Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of patients developing specific diseases based on their symptoms, medical history, and test results.
    - **Hospital Stay Duration Prediction**: Estimate the number of days a patient is likely to stay in the hospital, using features such as medical conditions, treatment plans, and historical stay data.
    - **Total Cost Prediction**: Predict the total cost of hospitalization, considering factors like admission type, treatment, test results, and duration of stay.
    - **Surgery Risk Prediction**: Assess the potential risks of surgery for patients based on their health metrics, medical history, and current condition.
    - **Survival Rate Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of patient survival based on features such as age, medical conditions, vital signs, comorbidities, and treatment plans.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics:
    - For **classification models** (e.g., disease prediction, surgery risk prediction, survival rate prediction), use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
    - For **regression models** (e.g., hospital stay duration, total cost prediction), use metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RÂ².
    - Fine-tune the models using hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search to improve performance and prediction accuracy.

4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models into a user-friendly application (e.g., Streamlit app). This application will allow healthcare providers and users to input patient data (demographics, symptoms, test results, etc.) and receive predictions related to:
    - Disease risk (likelihood of specific diseases).
    - Estimated hospital stay duration.
    - Projected total cost of treatment.
    - Surgery risk assessment.
    - Survival rate prediction (likelihood of patient survival).
