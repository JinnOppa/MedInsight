    1.**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather relevant hospital datasets that include patient demographics, medical conditions, test results, admission types, and historical stay durations.
    Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorizing features (e.g., age, gender, medical conditions, etc.).\n
    2.**Predictive Modeling:** Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost and Random Forest) and create models to predict **diseases** based on patient details such as symptoms, medical history, and test results,the number of **hospital stays** for future patients based on several features, as well as the **survival rates** of patients (high or low) based on several features available.\n
    3.**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for classification models, and RMSE or MAE for regression models and fine-tune the models using hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve model performance and prediction accuracy.\n
    4.**Deployment:** Deploy the trained models into a user-friendly application (e.g., Streamlit app) to allow healthcare providers and users to input new data and receive predictions regarding hospital stay requirements, patient survival probabilities, and potential diseases.
